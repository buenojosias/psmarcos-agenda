# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.4. You are an expert with the Laravel ecosystem. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Use `search-docs` before changes that depend on Laravel ecosystem APIs, behavior, configuration, or version-specific syntax. Skip it for copy-only edits and other changes where package documentation is irrelevant. Reuse sufficient results already in context instead of searching again.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Project Rules

- This project contains committed, area-grouped rules in `.ai/rules` when that directory exists (settled decisions, non-obvious traps, standing constraints). Framework and package guidelines that only apply to specific paths (testing, frontend, components) also live there, under `.ai/rules/boost` — this is not just recorded decisions, it is load-bearing guidance you have not seen inline. Before you enter plan mode or create/edit any file, you MUST first: open @.ai/rules/index.md (it maps file globs to rule files), read every rule file whose globs cover the path(s) in scope, and run `grep -rin 'keyword' .ai/rules` to catch what a path match alone misses. Do not write code until you have read and are following every matching rule. If `.ai/rules` does not exist, continue without it.
- Record a rule with `record-rule` only when the user explicitly asks for one. Instructions for the work at hand are not rules, no matter how emphatic: "remove this typo", "use X here" are work to do, not rules to record. Never record a rule on your own initiative, as a byproduct of a change, or to summarize what you just did. When the user does ask, pass a `glob` (e.g. `app/Http/Controllers/**`), a short `title`, and a few-line `note`. Use `record-rule` rather than your native memory or notes tool, because native memory is personal and session-scoped, while only `.ai/rules` is shared with the team and persists in the repo.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Follow existing application Enum naming conventions.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.
- Activate the `deploying-to-cloud` skill whenever deploying to Laravel Cloud, configuring Cloud environments or resources, using the Cloud CLI, or troubleshooting Cloud deployments.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Add or update tests for behavior and logic changes when a test provides meaningful regression coverage.
- Pure copy, styling, and layout-only changes do not require new or updated tests.
- When test coverage applies, run the affected tests and ensure they pass.
- Test the changed behavior and its important failure modes, but do not add tests beyond them.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill before writing tests.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allows you to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

# Pest

- This project uses Pest. Create tests with `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Do not include the test suite directory in `{name}`. Use `SomeFeatureTest`, not `Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill for guidance on coverage, naming, structure, dependency isolation, and review.
- Do not delete tests or test files without approval. They are part of the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the narrowest set of tests that covers the change. Pass a file path or `--filter=testName` to `php artisan test --compact`.
- Rerun a test after each change to it.
- Run `vendor/bin/pest` to call the test runner directly. It accepts the same file path and `--filter=testName` arguments.
- After the feature tests pass, ask the user to run the complete suite with `php artisan test --compact`.

=== tallstackui/tallstackui/core rules ===

# TallStackUI

- TallStackUI is a suite of 80+ Blade components for TALL Stack applications (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire). The complete documentation ships inside the package and matches the installed version. Read it before writing markup — never guess a prop, a slot, an event or a configuration key, and never invent a component that is not in the index.

## Where the documentation lives

- `vendor/tallstackui/tallstackui/.ai/index.md` — the component index, plus binding rules, usage outside Livewire, global configuration, skeletons, soft customization and the global JavaScript API.
- `vendor/tallstackui/tallstackui/.ai/components/<name>.md` — one page per component: every prop, slot, configuration key and customization block it exposes.
- `vendor/tallstackui/tallstackui/.ai/soft-customization-internal-scopes.md` — the canonical list of the scopes components use for their nested children.
- Start at the index to resolve the component's page path, then read that page. The website documents the latest release, which is not necessarily the one installed here.

## MCP server

- The same documentation is served over MCP at `https://tallstackui.com/mcp/tallstackui`, which is the better source when a task spans several components or searches for a class. Suggest connecting it when it is not configured yet:

<!-- Connect the TallStackUI MCP server to Claude Code -->
```shell
claude mcp add --transport http tallstackui https://tallstackui.com/mcp/tallstackui
```

<!-- Or commit .mcp.json in the project root to share it with the team -->
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "tallstackui": {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "https://tallstackui.com/mcp/tallstackui"
        }
    }
}
```

- Tools: `list-components-tool`, `get-component-tool`, `search-documentation-tool`, `search-customization-tool` and `search-classes-tool` — the last one returns the matching blocks with a ready override snippet.

## Component prefix

- `config('tallstackui.prefix')` (env `TALLSTACKUI_PREFIX`) prefixes every component tag: with `ts-`, `<x-alert />` is written `<x-ts-alert />`.
- Resolve the prefix before writing any tag, and follow whatever the existing Blade files in the application already do.
- `php artisan tallstackui:setup-prefix` configures it; `php artisan tallstackui:find-component <name>` reports where a component is already used.

## Installation

- Install the package:

<!-- Install TallStackUI -->
```shell
composer require tallstackui/tallstackui:^4.0
```

- Load the script in the layout:

<!-- Prepare the base layout -->
```blade
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- ... -->

        <tallstackui:script />
        @livewireStyles
        @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])
    </head>
</html>
```

- The script has to be loaded **above the `@vite` tag**.

- Add the marked lines to the Tailwind CSS v4 entry point, `resources/css/app.css`:

<!-- Tailwind CSS v4 entry point -->
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import '../../vendor/tallstackui/tallstackui/css/v4.css'; /* add */

@plugin '@tailwindcss/forms'; /* add */

@source '../../vendor/tallstackui/tallstackui/**/*.php'; /* add */
@source '../views';
@source '../../vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Pagination/resources/views/*.blade.php';
```

- Then build:

<!-- Build the assets -->
```shell
npm run build && php artisan optimize:clear
```

- Requirements: PHP 8.1+, Laravel 10+, Livewire 4+, Alpine.js 3+, Tailwind CSS 4+.
- Livewire's own script has to be on the page even when the components are used outside Livewire, because that is where Alpine comes from.

## Binding form components

- Inside Livewire, bind with `wire:model`. A nested path is valid as long as its head is a real property, which covers Form objects and arrays: `wire:model="form.files"`.
- Outside Livewire, give the component a `name` instead. It renders a hidden input, so a plain Blade form posting to a controller receives the value like any other field; `value` seeds the initial state. Single values arrive as they are, multi-value selections arrive JSON encoded.
- Key-Value, Form Upload, Loading, Reaction and Signature only work inside a Livewire component. Using them outside throws.

## Interactions: Toast, Dialog and Banner

- Place `<x-toast />`, `<x-dialog />` and `<x-banner />` once in the layout. Without the tag, nothing renders.
- Dispatch them with the `Interactions` trait, from a Livewire component or from a controller (where they are flashed to the session automatically):

<!-- Dispatching TallStackUI interactions -->
```php
use TallStackUi\Traits\Interactions;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    use Interactions;

    public function destroy(User $user): RedirectResponse
    {
        $this->toast()->success('Deleted', 'The user is gone.')->send();

        return back();
    }
}
```

- Banner has no `question()`. Dialog and Toast add `confirm()` and `cancel()` on top of `error()`, `info()`, `success()`, `warning()` and `question()`.

## Styling: soft customization

- Never edit anything under `vendor/`, and never publish the package views to restyle a component.
- Change classes at runtime from a service provider, targeting the blocks the component's documentation page lists:

<!-- Customizing a component's classes -->
```php
// In AppServiceProvider::boot()
TallStackUi::customize()->card()->block('wrapper.second')->append('ring-1 ring-gray-100');

// Opt-in variant, used as <x-card scope="flat" />
TallStackUi::customize('card', scope: 'flat')->block('wrapper.second')->remove('shadow-md');
```

- `block()`, `append()`, `prepend()`, `replace()`, `remove()`, `scope()` and `extend()` are the available methods. Customizations of the same block stack instead of overwriting each other, and a scope layers over the global customization rather than resetting it.
- Block names are keys, not paths: `wrapper.second` is one block, not `second` nested under `wrapper`.
- Write class names as complete literals so the application's Tailwind build can find them. Never build one by concatenation.
- Colors are customized through published color classes: `php artisan tallstackui:setup-color`.

## Configuration

- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=tallstackui.config` writes `config/tallstackui.php`, merged over the package defaults, so a file written against an older release keeps the options added since.
- Lists of scalars are the exception — they are taken as published rather than merged entry by entry, so publishing a shorter list narrows what is allowed.
- Per-component defaults live under `components.<name>` and are documented on each component's page.

## Table slots

- Table renders custom columns and expandable content through the `@interact` directive, keyed by the header index with dots replaced by underscores:

<!-- Custom table column -->
```blade
<x-table :$headers :rows="$this->rows">
    @interact('column_action', $row)
        <x-button.circle icon="pencil" wire:click="edit({{ $row->id }})" />
    @endinteract
</x-table>
```

## Global JavaScript API

- `$tsui.open.modal(name)` / `$tsui.close.modal(name)`, and the same pair for `slide` and `select`.
- `$tsui.open.commandPalette()` / `$tsui.close.commandPalette()`.
- `$tsui.focus(id)`, `await $tsui.copy(text)`, and `$tsui.interaction('toast'|'dialog')` to dispatch an interaction from the browser.
